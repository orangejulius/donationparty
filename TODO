Splash page:
* A simple cover page with a quick description of donation party
* email signup link

Core functionality
* send order to zinc
* send charity order to firstgivig

emails:
* confirmation email on order placed
* email on round closed?

UI Features
* Clearly inform how many donations are required before the round can finish on the rounds page
  - maybe show small boxes with generic images signifying a donation that has not yet happened yet?
* Add button to close round before it expires once enough people have donated
* add better calls to action all around

Refactoring
* HAML/SLIM everything
* Switch from seconds left

Minor/cleanup
* Ensure CC expiration date default is in the future
* Drive CC expiration date fields from data rather than hardcoding all months/years
