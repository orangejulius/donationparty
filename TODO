Features
* Clearly inform how many donations are required before the round can finish on the rounds page
  - maybe show small boxes with generic images signifying a donation that has not yet happened yet?
* Add button to close round before it expires once enough people have donated
* add better calls to action all around

Refactoring
* HAML/SLIM everything
* coffeescript everything

Minor/cleanup
* Create Rounds only when first visiting round page rather than on any visit to /
* Ensure CC expiration date default is in the future
* Drive CC expiration date fields from data rather than hardcoding all months/years
